# rhythmbox-radio-record
A rhythmbox 3 plugin to record internet radio using streamripper.

Adds "record/stop" toolbar buttons to each radio station in the list and allows for recording multiple radio streams at once.

Originally was going to be an edit of rhythmbox record-station...until I gave up and started from scratch.

As of April 24, 2015, this project has been stalled because I don't understand how to add UI windows (issue #10). I only know half-assed self-taught html/css (somewhat forgotten at this point) so my coding skills are literally the equivalent of a flowerpot. At least it's a working flowerpot.
