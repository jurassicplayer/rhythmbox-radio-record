# rhythmbox-radio-record
A rhythmbox 3 plugin to record internet radio using streamripper.

Currently doesn't actually do anything though. Adds a "record/stop" 
toolbar button to each radio station in the list and will supposedly 
allow for recording multiple radio streams at once.

Originally was going to be an edit of rhythmbox record-station...until I 
gave up and started from scratch.
